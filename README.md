#A Message to Future Govies from the Math/Computer Science Team Class of 2020:
#### We sincerely hope you enjoy your time at Governor's School and that's it not online (like ours was)! Don't be intimidated by the unknown. Many of us entered this program  never expecting to be able to accomplish things seen in this project. Lastly, savor every moment because it'll be over before you know it.
